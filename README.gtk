For the graphical gtk+ client you need to --enable-gtk,
if you want the icons of idled users to be dulled --enable-dulled as well.

To use icon files:
edit $HOME/.ghxvars
and add
user_icon_files[0]='/home/david/zombie.rsrc'
icon_files[0]='/home/david/icons.rsrc'

user_icon_files[0] is the userlist icons to use..
icon_files[0] is the icon set to use for buttons.

get userlist icons from http://badmoon.org and the button icons from
http://hx.fortyoz.org.
