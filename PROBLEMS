Problems encountered when building hxd on some old platforms.

AIX
===
due to bugs in L. Ron Hubbard knows what, configure will
generate a broken config.h on a version of AIX.

change:
#define u_int8_t unsigned char char
#define u_int16_t unsigned short short
#undef u_int32_t
#undef HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H

to:
#define u_int8_t unsigned char
#define u_int16_t unsigned short
#define u_int32_t unsigned int
#define HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H

BSDI
====
gcc version 2.7.2.1 on the BSDI system I used did not compile
hxd correctly.
gcc 1.42 worked, on the system i used this was `cc'.

HPUX
====
with sql you might need to link with -lm

NextStep
========
use gcc -posix
malloc does not work when linking with -lposix, so you must extract the object
files needed from libposix.a and link with those.

OpenBSD / gcc 2.8.1
===================
On OpenBSD with gcc 2.8.1, if you get a core dump in hlwrite, try compiling
without optimization, this works a little better, but get a working compiler.
