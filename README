This is mhxd, a merge of the 3 different forks of hxd.

hx is a free set of software using hotline protocols.
For information about Hotline, see:

See the AUTHORS file for contact information.

To compile hxd, you need an ANSI C compiler, preferably the GNU C compiler.
Traditional compilers may work, if they understand function prototypes.
The ultrix 4.3 compiler does, if your compiler does not, try ansi2knr.
The Tiny C Compiler (Linux only) will compile hxd very fast, but apparently
causes hxd to segfault.

If you run into problems building or running, see PROBLEMS.

Building instructions
=====================

hxd server
==========
$ ./configure --enable-hxd
By default pthreads are used if available, to disable, use --without-pthreads
$ make

To install it in ./run/hxd/ :
$ make install

To start the server:
$ cd ./run/hxd
$ bin/hxd [-p port (default 5500)] [-f hxd.conf]

To leave it in the background, add & to the end of the command line.

to register with a tracker:
configure with --enable-tracker-register
and edit the tracker section of hxd.conf

To compile the tracker server:
configure with --enable-hxtrackd

To enable /exec and /find:
configure with --enable-exec

To edit accounts on a tty, use acctedit (src/acctedit/acctedit)
Enter toggles access, s saves, q quits.

Many other optional configure options exist.
For a list, run ./configure --help

hx client
=========
To compile the client, configure with --enable-hx
You may need to get libreadline from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/

Soundsets are loaded with snd -S sndset_file
Turn sounds on/off with snd -O/-o

ghx client
==========
Add --enable-gtk to the configure flags.

Specify icon files with icon_files[i]=...
User icon files with user_icon_files[i]=...
Files with lower indexen are loaded first
For example:
icon_files[0]=icons.rsrc
user_icon_files[0]=bm_icons.rsrc
user_icon_files[1]=icons.rsrc

SOCKS proxy support
===================
hxd can use the socks5 library from http://www.socks.nec.com/
use the --with-socks and/or --with-socks-include configure options.
