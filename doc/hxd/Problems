This file mostly pertains to people compiling the server but should make
good bedtime study for people interested in the process.

compress isn't working when i log in
====================================

In order to enable compress techniques you must log into a hope'd server with
a hope'd client (and both compress'd server and client). Then you can use
compress. I'll work on a fix for this, but it may be both a client problem
and server problem or either one, i don't know right now.

find isn't working and says something about usage
=================================================

The find tool that the script uses in your Operating System is likely based
on BSD standards and therefore is currently not supported. I tried to support
it but for some reason or another has broken recently. Just do what everybody
else does and go to http://synhxd.sf.net and download the prepackaged update
for Mac OS X (if that is what you are using). If you are on another BSD
flavored operating system, head on over to freshmeat.net to grab the source
and compile it. Direct link: http://freshmeat.net/projects/findutils/

btw, don't be lazy, just install them, you'll be glad you did, they have
way more options than your BSD compatible one including all the options you
are used to.

Can't Connect to Server
=======================

Here's a list of simple things to check:

Check your port setting in hxd.conf, sometimes i forget to revert it back to
5500 before i release (as I test the sources on 5600 before release). Next,
check your log to see if it was able to correctly bind to the address and
port specified. The log should say so if it was unable to do so. Lastly, make
sure that your firewall (if you have one) is set up to allow the connection.

Netstat Kills Uploads
=====================

Upon release of 0.1.58, it was tested on OpenBSD 3.0. Whenever the netstat
command was called, it would kill any active file transfers. The cause of
this error is unknown and could not be fixed at the time of this writing.
The problem could not be replicated on any other server type. You should
not have anything to worry about if you are not running OpenBSD 3.0. If
this does occur to you, simply disable the netstat script by moving it
out of your exec directory.

- update -

It is now believed to be a network transport bug related to OpenBSD 3.0.
Only current solution is to delete the netstat script from your exec dir
and avoid using it at all costs.

Can't delete files
==================

It has been known that if you don't enable hfs support (--enable-hfs) it might
occur that you are not given the option to delete files (even if you have full
priveleges on your account). The solution is to enable hfs support.

Can't get info on files
=======================

This is the result of not enabling hfs support. What's that? You say you
enabled hfs support? Think again, this bug does not occur unless you forgot
to enable hfs. Check your config.status file header to see what you compiled
your binary with. If it says you did `--enable-hfs' then try running
`make distclean' from the root of the hxd folder and re-doing everything.

Mac OS X
========
***** /find *****

Mac OS X has a BSD find version. It doesn't support -iname (case-
insensitive searching). The find script will work fine with your built-in
find but will disable case-insensitive searching.

If you wish to upgrade the find utility in OS X (darwin), it's a very
easy process. Simply download the GNU find 4.1 Darwin that i packaged,
then run install.sh
