Installing
==========

Installing this binary is quite easy. You can move the entire
hxd folder anywhere you like on your hard drive.

Brushing up
===========

Make sure to read everything in th `doc' folder.

Configuring
===========

Before you run your hotline server, you need to configure it.
Open the file named `hxd.conf'. Most importantly you need to
edit the port your server runs on. The default is 5500.

You will see an entry like the following (near the top of
the hxd.conf file):

     port 5500;

This line tells hxd what port to run on. Feel free to make
any other changes you desire before starting your server.

Running
=======

To run your hxd (or compatible server), simply open a terminal
window and go to your folder on the command line. Then type
the following commands (do not type the percent sight):

     % ./hxd&

This will launch hxd in the background.

Stopping the Server
===================

You need to locate your server in a list of running
applications.  To do this, open a terminal window. On the
command line, type the following (do not type percent sign):

     % ps ax | grep hxd

You will receive a message resembling the following text:

     2529  ??  S      5:12.48 ./hxd
     5439 std  RV+    0:00.34 grep hxd

The test in the far right column is the command you typed.
Since you launched it with `./hxd' the top one is the
running program. To stop it, you need the numbers in the
far left column (called a pid or process id). In this case
it would obviously be 2529. So to kill your hxd, you would
say on the command line (without the percent sign):

     % kill -9 2529

Reconfiguring
=============

If you make a change to your hxd.conf file, the server will
not automatically reload it. You have to tell it to reload
it. To reload it, you need the pid of your running server.
To get the pid, refer to the above section (`Quitting the
Server'). Once you have the pid, type the following on the
command line (without percent sign)(using 2529 as example):

     % kill -HUP 2529
