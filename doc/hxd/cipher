To compile cipher (encryption) support:

You need the openssl development libraries.
To install them:

Download the tarball.

http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6c.tar.gz

Then execute the following on the command line:

	% tar zxf openssl-0.9.6c.tar.gz
	% cd openssl-0.9.6c
	% ./config
	% make

On Mac OS X, Darwin, or BSD Systems:

	% sudo make test
	% sudo make install

On other systems:

	% su
	# make test
	# make install

Note: in the above, the percent sign indicates the
assumption of a non-root basis. The hash sign (`#')
indicates the assumption of a root basis. In both
circumstance, neither of these characters should be
taken as literal portions of the command. Only the
commands after these characters should be typed on
the command line.

If you have installed it correctly, you should see
the development libraries at:

/usr/local/ssl/include

After you have installed your openssl headers, in
the hxd source folder, execute the following:

	% ./configure --enable-hope --enable-cipher
	% make

You should now have a binary of a fully ciphered
hxd in your run folder. To install hxd to the
following folder (/usr/local/hxd), do this:

On Mac OS X, Darwin, or BSD Systems:

	% sudo make install

On other systems:

	# make install


Good luck, and cheers,
