This document descibes how to make binaries for your platform.

There is a utility for making binaries for your platform that
I have made. From the root of the shxd folder, type the
following commands:

     % ./configure
     % make binaries

Before you do this, make sure of somethings, you want at
least 100MB of hard drive space to be safe. That you have
a lot of time. The `mkbin' script will test your system and
compile as many binary combinations as it can using numerous
combinations of --enable options.

The advantages to this script are merely to compile binaries
for other people. There are currently a total of 12 binary
combinations given what i've told it to compile.
