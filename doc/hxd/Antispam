To use antispam, enable it in hxd.conf.
Then configure the spam section of hxd.conf to your needs.
the format is like this:

spamconf
TransID   SpamCount  Comment
      0   10         # default
    101   20         # NewsGet
    .
    .
    .
;

The comment is just for you to know what it is about. The transaction id (transid) is the transaction. You must terminate the table with a ';'.

You can set the spam_max and spam_time values to control the maximum spam count that users can reach in a certain interval.

Here's how it works:
Hotline is made by transaction, each action has a corresponding transaction. When the transaction specified in spam.conf happens, the client SpamCurrent value is increased by the SpamCount given to that transaction. If ever SpamCurrent >= SpamMax, the client gets kicked. Each SpamCheck seconds, SpamCurrent is resetted to zero. If no SpamCount value is given for a transaction (because not defined in spamconf), it has a default value of 10.

You may also notice that accounts having 'can_spam=1' in their access
won't get kicked. Also, those account holders won't be banned if they
reconnect very fast.
