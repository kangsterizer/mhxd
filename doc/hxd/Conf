This documents the use of 'conf' files.

While 'access' files give accounts more access and various extra features,
'conf' files allow you to redefine configuration objects based on the account
rather than all accounts.

The basic theory of this file is that it is used to set local properties to an
account that override properties set in hxd.conf.

So far you can specify based on the account, the limit of individual uploads,
the limit of individual downloads, and max download speed per download.

Example...

	limits {
		individual_downloads 64;
		individual_uploads 64;

		individual_exec 2;

		# 5 MB/s
		out_Bps 5242880;
		# no limit when uploading
		uploader_out_Bps 0;
	}

	spam {
		spam_max 1000;
		spam_time 10;
		chat_max 1000;
		chat_time 10;
	}

If you place the example above in a file named "conf" (no quotes) in the users
account folder then it will override the server settings in hxd.conf. For
example, if you have set the server setting to only allow 1 download per
person, every account will only be allowed to download one file at a time
accept the admin (for whom you have blessed with the above example in their
conf file). 

It is to be set up in the same manner as hxd.conf, you must provide groupings
(such as how individual_downloads is within the limits grouping).

Lines beginning with (ignoring whitespace) the number sign (`#') are ignored.

As of this writing, the items in the example are the only supported items in
this file, but this file will be expanded upon in the future.
