This document describes the details of using TextEdit on Mac OS X.

TextEdit on Mac OS X can sometimes break functionality on programs
that run on a UNIX command interface (like this one). The reason is,
that when reading a configuration file, it delimits the file by the
Line Feed character. The Line Feed character is the standard "new
line" character.

On Macintosh, the "new line" character is the Carriage Return. On
Windows platforms the "new line" character is both the Line Feed and
the Carriage Return characters combined.

TextEdit has two modes to it. Rich Text and Plain Text. In Rich Text
mode, it uses the Carriage Return for new lines. This will break the
file and make it unreadable to this program. You want to edit the
file in Plain Text mode. You can do this by selecting Plain Text from
one of the menus in the menubar.
