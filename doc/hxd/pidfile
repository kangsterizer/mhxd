This document explains how to create a pidfile from hxd.

When you launch hxd you can pass it a parameter. Here is the
syntax of the hxd binary.

./hxd -o pidfile

If you call hxd like this, for example:

./hxd -o /var/run/hxd.pid

hxd will output it's pid to the file at /var/run/hxd.pid.
The overall advantages of this feature are the ability
to create rc scripts for hxd.

Further details on this process will be documented in a
later revision.

An rc script has already been created for you and is in
the `rc' directory. Also, read the `README' file in that
directory for instructions on how to use it.
