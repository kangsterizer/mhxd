This document describes the various extra priveleges you can specify to user
accounts in a text file name access in the account folder.


Where is this 'access' file?

   The access file is a plain text file with that is in the user's account
folder. For example, if the account is admin, you would make a text file in
./accounts/admin/ (starting at the root of synhxd). All extra priveleges for
the account 'admin' are specified in this file (ie. ./accounts/admin/access).
All properties can either be 1 or 0.

debug

   Default Value: 0
   Description: if hxd was compiled with the XMALLOC_DEBUG constant and
      debug=1 then this command will print debugging information to the log.

user_access

   Default Value: 0
   Description: if user_access=1 then the user is allowed to use the access
      chat command (changes the access priveleges on connected users). You
      can feed /access any one of these properties.
      For example:
         /access 1 user_visibility=1
      will give the user of uid 1 the ability to toggle their visibility in
      the user list.

access_volatile

   Default Value: 1
   Description: if access_volatile=1 then the user's access priveleges can be
      changed via a person with user_access=1 and via the mon command.
      This setting is used to identify someone that should not be given more
      privileges that is "dangerous" with privileges. If you set
      access_volatile=0 then the user's access priveleges cannot be changed
      unless they are manually changed in the access file. (see /access in
      the HXDCommands document)

user_0wn

   Default Value: 0
   Description: if user_0wn=1 then the user is allowed to use the 0wn command
      on other connected users. (note: that is_0wn3d=1 must be true about the
      person you are using /0wn on)

is_0wn3d

   Default Value: 1
   Description: if is_0wn3d=0 then someone with user_0wn=1 cannot use the /0wn
      command on you.

can_spam

   Default Value: 0
   Description: if can_spam=1 then the user is allowed to spam. If hxd is
      configured with --enabled-nospam then anyone spamming (what constitutes
      a spam is defined in hxd.conf) is kicked.

manage_users

   Default Value: 0
   Description: if manage_users=1 then the user is allowed to use the /users
      command (which allows you to see invisible users). (an shxd feature)

user_color

   Default Value: 0
   Description: if user_color=1 then the user is allowed to use the /color
      command (which allows you to change the color of your name).

color

   Default Value: <none>
   Description: this allows you to set the color that you should have when you
      log in (rather than being based off of your permissions). The format is
      simply the numeric color code (ie. putting 'color=0' in your access
      file will make you black on login regardless of hor many privs you
      have). This may be useful if you do not want to be known as the admin.

icon

   Default Value: <none>
   Description: this allows you to set the icon that you should have when you
      log in (rather than being passed by the client at login time). The
      format is simply the id of the icon (ie. putting 'icon=190' in your
      access file will give you the icon id 190 when you log in regardless of
      what your client passed). Note: this does not affect your ability to
      change your icon. You can always change your icon.
