Making account based drop boxes.

Q. What is an account based drop box?
A. An account based drop box is a drop box that only the account holder can
   view the contents of. Meaning that if you wanted to create several accounts
   that have a drop box but you don't want them to be able to view other's
   drop boxes. Of course though, administrators can always view everybodies
   drop boxes at any time.

Q. How do I create one? and when I create it, who owns it?
A. An account based drop box is created by making a folder inside that person's
   account folder. Then he/she becomes the owner of it. The folder must be
   named "dropbox" and be inside the account folder. You then make a link or
   alias to it in the files folder anywhere. You might want to have the name of
   the link or alias contain the letters (in sequence, case-insensitive)
   "drop box" so that the client recognizes it as a drop box.

Q. What can be done with this dropbox?
A. The person using this box (ie. the account holder) can upload to it (if they
   have the privelege to upload files set on their account) and can view the
   contents of the folder. Other than that, what they can do is based on their
   priveleges (ie. if they have the privelege to delete files they can delete
   files in this folder as well as any other folder).
