ChangeLog for mhxd

version 0.4.11:
* fixed gcc-4.1.1 compile errors for hx

version 0.4.10:
* (kang) src/hxd/hlserver.c src/common/hxd.h, src/common/hotline.h, src/hxd/rcv.c: added
avaraline.net self-loading icon support. Thanks vertigo for the help :)
* (kang) src/acctedit/acctedit.c: minor typo fix :)
* (kang) run/hxd/exec: added /update script, mhxd version checking. Check at
login for admins per default. (thx shiva y a)
* (kang) src/hxd/commands.c: moved cmd_snd_chat above CONFIG_EXEC, or compilation would fail when disabling exec at configure time. Thanks ben_g.
* (kang) src/hxd/commands.c: restored logging of ownages.
* (kang) src/hxd/htxf.c: fixed usleep for BSD's and Win32, they wouldn't accept
passing values over 1000000 and would return immeditaly (making capping
unefficient). This replace the dirty Win32 fix. (taken from shxd, thanks
devin)
* (kang) src/hx/hx_tty.c, src/hx/hx_commands.c: added mkick command from kehx/ehx,
allows kicking back users when they rejoin. evil :>
* (kang) src/hxd/htxf.c: changed ENOTSUP for OpenBSD only (different references of
errno, refer to manpage) and therefore fixed compilation on this platform
* (kang) various scripts: fixed a few pure sh issues
* (kang) src/hx/connect.c src/hx/hx_rcv.c: removed output.on_connect() from 1.5+
agreement, now execute after login on any serverversion. Reason: if the server
supports 1.5+ protocol and the account doesn't have an agreement file,
output.on_connect() would never be executed.
* src/hxd/hxd.c: in signal handlers, set variable last_signal which is checked
                 in loopZ. Avoid calling library functions in signal handlers.
* (kang) src/common/hxd.c: added -o flag to specify a file to where pid inside
(usefull for multiple hxd's running)
